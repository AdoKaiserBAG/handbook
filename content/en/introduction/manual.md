This manual explains the main features of the I14Y interoperability platform. It contains numerous step-by-step instructions. It also provides technical details and background information on data harmonisation and standardisation.

The first chapter highlights the [Roles and Processes](/handbook/en/gouvernance) in data management. The chapter [Retrieve Metadata
](/handbook/de/metadaten_abrufen) describes how to obtain information from the I14Y interoperability platform. The following chapter [Publishing metadata](/handbook/de/publikation) explains how to publish descriptions of data sets, electronic interfaces and data elements on the platform. It also shows how the directory of government services is compiled.

<!--Später ergänzen: Nebst den schriftlichen Anleitungen enthält dieses Handbuch auch einige Videotutorials.--> 
The handbook also contains a [Glossary](/handbook/de/7_glossar) with technical terms, a [list with web links](/handbook/de/anhang/weblinks), an overview of the [partner organisations](/handbook/de/8_partner) as well as a [Log](/handbook/de/anhang/changelog) of the most important changes that have been made to the platform.
