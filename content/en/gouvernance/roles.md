Some users of the I14Y interoperability platform want to retrieve entries only. Others collect metadata. Others validate the information and make it publicly available. In order to regulate access rights and editing competences, the Confederation's [role-based model for data management](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/nadb/nadb.assetdetail.14965606.html) is used on the I14Y-IOP. Among others, the following roles are distinguished:

- __Data owners__ (_data owners_) make decisions on the content and the purpose of a data set. They commission it and they are responsible for it.
- __Data stewards__ (_data stewards_) are responsible for the technical aspects of data maintenance. They coordinate the work on standardisation and harmonisation of the data sets. This role exists both within the organisation (_local data steward_) and on a national level (_Swiss data steward_) or in a specialist area (e.g., _data steward statistics_).
- __Data custodians__ (_data custodians_) are responsible for technical tasks, such as database support.
- __Data consumers__ (_data consumers_) retrieve and process data.

Those who want to access only public data on the I14Y-IOP do not need to log in. However, in order to view non-public entries of one's own organisation or to save, edit, validate and publish metadata, an account with the appropriate rights is needed. The corresponding access rights are usually assigned by the organisation's internal account administrators when the account is created ([see under account administration](/handbook/de/plattform/kontenverwaltung)). 

The table below shows which tasks can be undertaken in which role. There are two levels: that of the organisation concerned -- for example, a federal office, a canton or a commune -- and the highest national level. In practice, in smaller organisations it is possible for one person to take on several of these roles. In large organisations, several people often share the work in question.

| Roles | Authorisations |
| ----  | ---- |
| _Data Consumers_ | The I14Y interoperability platform can be visited without a user account. Users who are not logged in can only see the publicly published metadata. Furthermore, no metadata can be saved without a login. Registered and logged-in users can see the non-public entries of their own organisation in addition to the publicly published metadata. They can only read them, but not edit or publish them. |
| _Stewardship Organization Viewer_ | The _Organizational Viewer_ sees the internal metadata of their own organisation in addition to the publicly published metadata. However, they cannot edit it. |
| _Submitter_ | The submitters save the metadata on behalf of the _Local Data Stewards_. They cannot validate and activate the entries themselves. They see the publicly published metadata as well as the contents of their own organisation. |
| _Local Data Steward_ | The local data stewards in the individual organisations ensure that the information is as complete as possible. They also check whether formal criteria have been met and they work towards harmonising and standardising data sets. If the information on the I14Y-IOP is correct, they publish the metadata. If an entry is to be publicly listed and labelled as compliant with the standard, the local data stewards pass the metadata on to the Interoperability Office for validation. |
| _Interoperability Office_ | The Interoperability Office (IOS), the I14Y team based at the Federal Statistical Office, coordinates data standardisation and harmonisation throughout Switzerland. It develops tools, ensures the coordination of standardisation and harmonisation tasks between the participating organisations, and supports the local data stewards in modelling the metadata. The staff of the interoperability unit must confirm whether a data offer on the I14Y interoperability platform is to be marked as standard-compliant. |
| _Swiss Data Steward_ | In its role as _Swiss Data Steward_, the Federal Statistical Office coordinates Switzerland-wide standardisation and harmonisation work on administrative data from public administrations. |
