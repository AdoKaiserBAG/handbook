I14Y can be used by authorities at all federal levels. In order for metadata to be entered and published, a separate area must be created for each organisation. And read and write permissions must be assigned. This is usually done by one person in the organisation concerned. The first section shows how [access is managed](/handbook/en/platform/accounts).

I14Y will continue to be actively developed during the project phase until the end of 2026. The [roadmap](/handbook/en/plattform/roadmap), the second section of this chapter, explains when which function should be available and how suggestions for new functions are submitted. 

The [support](/handbook/en/platform/support) section shows who to contact in the event of problems.
