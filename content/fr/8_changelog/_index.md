The I14Y interoperability platform is under active development. New features are added with each release. Bugs are also fixed. The most important changes are briefly documented below. For detailed information on the development of the platform, please contact the [I14Y team] (mailto:i14y@bfs.admin.ch). 

## Release 5 February 2024
- The channels of a public service are now displayed directly on the overview page. Previously, they could be found in a separate tab. This change allows users to access the public service with fewer clicks. 
- Records can now be assigned to multiple catalogues. For example, a record can be part of both the I14Y and Opendata catalogues. The keywords, which may differ from catalogue to catalogue, can be set for each catalogue. 

## Release 25 January 2024
- Introduction of new fields to document the protection status of the da dataset: Thanks to the news fields, it is possible to enter information about whether a record contains personal data or even particularly sensitive personal data. Information about the retention period of the data can also be recorded.
- First implementation of the Catalog class. In the future, several catalogues can be managed on the I14Y. Records can be assigned to one or more catalogues. 
- Provision of a machine-readable security information file (security.txt) according to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) specification.
